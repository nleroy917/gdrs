# gdrs
`gdrs` is a rust implementation of the [GenomicDistributions](https://github.com/databio/GenomicDistributions) package.

## Roadmap
Ideally, we would like to implement all the features of the original package. However, we are starting with the basic features and will add more features as we go along.

- [ ] Chromosome distribution
- [x] Neighbor distances
- [ ] GC content
- [ ] Partition plots
- [ ] Cumulative partition plots
- [ ] Distance to TSS
- [ ] Dinucleotide frequency

## Installation
```bash
cargo add gdrs
```
